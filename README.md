# Bright Futures 🌅  
**Invest in Potential. Harvest Success.**

Bright Futures is a decentralized platform on **Sui** that reimagines how education is funded. Instead of relying on traditional student loans, learners can request financial support directly from investors who believe in their potential. When an investor proposes a smart contract and the student accepts, **funds are deposited** in SUI and released gradually over time. In return, the student commits to sharing a small **percentage of their future income** for an agreed period.  

This innovative model allows investors to receive digital tokens that represent their stake in a student’s journey. These tokens are **tradeable**, introducing liquidity into an entirely new asset class: **human potential**. To merge the digital and real worlds, every signed PDF agreement is stored immutably using **Walrus**, ensuring accountability and transparency while preserving legal enforceability.  

By turning education financing into a shared journey, Bright Futures empowers students and creates opportunities for anyone to participate in shaping tomorrow’s talent. When students thrive, their supporters thrive too.
